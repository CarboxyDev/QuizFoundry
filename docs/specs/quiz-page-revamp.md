# Quiz Page Revamp

- This page is for the user attempting a quiz.
- The code must be modular since in the future a new page will be made for previewing quizzes instead of attempting.
- Retain the sticky header UI that comes up after scrolling.
- Revamp the card design for the question as well as the options. Do not use Card component. Instead, innovate and make the UI yourself while following similar theme as the whole webapp. The cards must be sleek and modern.
- The revamped cards must not take as much space as before. Still, they should have decent amounts of whitespace.
- Make sure the question and the question number indicator are both fantastic.
- Make sure that you create the UI for the feedback regarding whether a question's attempted answer was correct or not after the quiz is submitted. Also make sure that this feedback UI is very clear.
- For the answered feedback, you can add a circular badge with a checkmark on the top right of the card. When I say top right I mean it should be centered at the top right border of the card.

- For the header section (non sticky), do a major revamp. Get inspired from the header UI in quizzes page.
- The submit button should be in a dedicated section UI at the bottom. It should look good and be fairly fancy. Remember that there will probably be more sub-UI added here.
