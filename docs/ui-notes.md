# UI Notes & Design Decisions

# General UI Guidelines

- Dark theme (base tailwind color) website
- Primary/Accent color is primary tailwind color.
- Use Shadcn components for the Form, Button, Input, etc.
- Website must be responsive. First priority is laptop and desktops then mobile.

# Sign up page

- 2 panel layout with:
  - Panel 1: Sign Up Form
  - Panel 2: Hero Section (with heading, tagline, graphic)
- Decent yet smooth animations using framer-motion
- Keep the page good looking but not too fancy / over-the-top

# Create quiz page

- Minimalist page with a single big dynamic input in the middle for inputting the prompt to generate the quiz
- UI elements that will be optional to select from are like difficulty selector, options count (min: 2, max: 8)
- make other UI elements as needed if you think they will make sense for an AI Quiz Maker
- Stick with primary and base colors
