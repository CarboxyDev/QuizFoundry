## Analytics Metrics Explained

### Overview Metrics

- **totalAttempts**: Total number of quiz attempts
- **uniqueUsers**: Number of unique users who attempted the quiz
- **averageScore**: Average percentage score across all attempts
- **averageTimeSpent**: Average time spent (in minutes) - currently 0 as time tracking is not implemented
- **completionRate**: Percentage of attempts that were completed (currently 100% as we only track completed attempts)
- **highestScore**: Highest percentage score achieved
- **lowestScore**: Lowest percentage score achieved

### Performance Metrics

- **scoreDistribution**: Breakdown of scores into ranges with counts and percentages
- **difficultyRating**:
  - `perceived`: The difficulty level set by the quiz creator
  - `actualDifficulty`: Calculated difficulty based on performance (1=Easy, 2=Medium, 3=Hard, 4=Very Hard)

### Engagement Metrics

- **attemptsOverTime**: Daily attempt counts for the last 30 days
- **topPerformers**: Top 10 highest-scoring attempts with user information
- **recentActivity**: Attempt counts for different time periods

### Question-Level Analysis

- **correctRate**: Percentage of correct answers for each question
- **difficulty**: Calculated difficulty based on correct rate (easy: â‰¥80%, medium: 60-79%, hard: <60%)
- **optionAnalysis**: Selection frequency for each answer option

  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Example

```typescript
import axios from "axios";

const getQuizAnalytics = async (quizId: string, token: string) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(`/api/analytics/quiz/${quizId}`, {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      },

    return response.data.data.analytics;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching analytics:", error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

## Database Performance

The analytics API uses several optimizations:

1. **Indexes**: Specialized indexes for time-based and quiz-specific queries
2. **Views**: Pre-computed analytics summary view for quick overview stats
3. **Functions**: Database functions for complex calculations
4. **Efficient Queries**: Minimized N+1 queries through proper joins

## Future Enhancements

1. **Time Tracking**: Implement actual time spent tracking
2. **Real-time Analytics**: WebSocket support for live analytics
3. **Comparative Analytics**: Compare performance across similar quizzes
4. **Export Functionality**: Export analytics data to CSV/PDF
5. **Historical Trends**: Long-term trend analysis beyond 30 days
